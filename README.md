# My Solution for the [GDC Software Engineering Fellowship](https://fullstack.gdc.network/) Test

_2022 batch_

This [solution](java/Task.java) (in java) bagged me a place among the 98 students shortlisted for an interview.  
Providing **two bugfixes** _(yes, the archive provided had errors)_ probably helped too.

See [PROBLEM-STATEMENT.md](java/PROBLEM-STATEMENT.md) (originally named README.md by GDC) for the question.
